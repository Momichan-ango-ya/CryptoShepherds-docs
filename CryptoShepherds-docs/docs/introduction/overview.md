# Overview


**# We aim to make decentralized storage usable like Google Drive or Dropbox.**


## What is CryptoShepherds?
---

The CryptoShepherds Protocol addresses the issue of default public access in decentralized storage by developing middleware that integrates folder structures and decentralized access control without the need for sharing encryption keys. 

Developers can easily and integratively use data storage with folder structures and decentralized access control by simply incorporating the library and setting the destination folder and decryption conditions. 

It creates folder structures through symmetric key-based hierarchical encryption, enabling secure folder sharing without the need to share encryption keys.
